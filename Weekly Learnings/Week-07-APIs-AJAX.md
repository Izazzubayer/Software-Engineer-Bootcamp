## Project 2: Interactive JavaScript Portfolio

Add to your Week 3 portfolio:

- [ ] Load projects from a JSON file (or simple API)
- [ ] Contact form validation (client-side)
- [ ] Filter/search projects
- [ ] Dark mode toggle
- [ ] Smooth scroll navigation
- [ ] Fetch external data (e.g. GitHub repos)

---

## What to focus on

- **Fetch:** `fetch(url)`, `.then(res => res.json())`, check `res.ok`, handle errors
- **HTTP:** GET for data, POST for create; status codes (200, 201, 404, 500)
- **API keys:** store in env or config, never commit secrets
- **CORS:** browser security; when you need a backend proxy or API CORS headers

## Weekly time split (12–16 hrs)

| Activity | Hours |
|----------|--------|
| API tutorials + one API doc | 3–4 |
| 2–3 small API projects | 4–5 |
| Portfolio interactivity | 4–7 |
