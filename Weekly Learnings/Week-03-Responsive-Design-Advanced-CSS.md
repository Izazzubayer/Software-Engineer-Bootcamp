## Project 1: Personal Portfolio Website

Build a **fully responsive portfolio** with:

- About section
- Skills section
- Project gallery (placeholders OK)
- Contact form (non-functional for now)
- Smooth animations and transitions

---

## What to focus on

- **Mobile-first:** base styles for small screens, then `min-width` media queries
- **Breakpoints:** e.g. 480px, 768px, 1024px; consistent approach
- **CSS Grid:** `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-areas`, `gap`
- **DevTools:** inspect layout, test breakpoints, check overflow
