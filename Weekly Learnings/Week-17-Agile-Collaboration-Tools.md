## Practice

- [ ] Create a branch, make changes, open a PR, merge (on a real or practice repo)
- [ ] Resolve a merge conflict (create one on purpose)
- [ ] Use GitHub Projects: add a few tasks, move them (e.g. Todo → In Progress → Done)
- [ ] Write 5 commit messages that follow “type: short description” (e.g. feat: add login)

## Project 4: Full-Stack Social Media Dashboard

Build a complete app:

- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] User profiles (view + edit)
- [ ] Posts: create, edit, delete
- [ ] Like and comment
- [ ] Optional: real-time (WebSockets) or image upload (e.g. Cloudinary)
- [ ] Responsive; deploy frontend and backend

---

## What to focus on

- **Git flow:** main branch; feature branches; merge via PR
- **Code review:** what to look for (logic, style, security, tests)
- **Agile:** short cycles, user stories, acceptance criteria; standup/sprint/retro as concepts
- **CI/CD:** automate test and deploy on push; you’ll implement in Week 28

## Weekly time split (12–16 hrs)

| Activity | Hours |
|----------|--------|
| Git/Agile tutorials + PR practice | 3–4 |
| Social dashboard (continuation) | 8–10 |
| GitHub Projects + commit discipline | 1–2 |

---

## Checklist

- [ ] Opened and merged at least one PR; resolved a conflict once
- [ ] Used GitHub Projects for your dashboard tasks
- [ ] Social dashboard deployed and working
- [ ] Ready for Algorithms (Week 18)
