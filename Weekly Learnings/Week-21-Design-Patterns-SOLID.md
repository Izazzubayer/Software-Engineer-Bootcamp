# Week 21 — Design Patterns & SOLID Principles

**Theme:** Algorithms & Data Structures  
**Suggested time:** 12–16 hours total

---

## Learning goals

- Creational: Singleton, Factory (and Factory Method)
- Structural: Adapter, Decorator
- Behavioral: Observer, Strategy
- SOLID: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
- When NOT to over-engineer with patterns

## Practice

- [ ] Implement 2–3 patterns in a small example (e.g. Observer for event system, Strategy for sort)
- [ ] Refactor a piece of your project code using one SOLID principle (e.g. extract a class for one responsibility)
- [ ] Draw or describe architecture of your Task API or Social Dashboard (components, layers)

---

## Project 5: Data Visualization Dashboard

Build an interactive dashboard:

- [ ] Fetch a complex dataset (e.g. public API or CSV)
- [ ] Process data efficiently (filter, sort, aggregate)
- [ ] Visualize with D3.js or Chart.js
- [ ] Filter, sort, search; optional real-time update
- [ ] Export (CSV/PDF) optional
- [ ] Performance: avoid unnecessary re-renders; virtualize if large lists

---

## What to focus on

- **Single Responsibility:** one class/function one reason to change
- **Open/Closed:** extend via new code, not by changing existing
- **Patterns:** use to solve recurring design problems; don’t force them everywhere
- **Interview:** be able to name one pattern and where you’d use it

## Weekly time split (12–16 hrs)

| Activity | Hours |
|----------|--------|
| Design patterns + SOLID tutorials | 4–5 |
| Implement 2–3 patterns + one refactor | 3–4 |
| Data viz dashboard start | 4–7 |

---

## Checklist

- [ ] Can explain 2–3 patterns and SOLID in your own words
- [ ] Refactored something using SRP or OCP
- [ ] Data viz dashboard in progress or done
- [ ] Ready for React (Week 22)
