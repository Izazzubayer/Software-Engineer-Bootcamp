# Week 35 — Capstone: Advanced Features & Polish

**Theme:** Capstone Project  
**Suggested time:** 12–16 hours total

---

## Learning goals

- Complete remaining user stories
- Optional: real-time (WebSockets), notifications, advanced filters
- UI/UX polish: loading states, error states, empty states
- Accessibility improvements
- Performance: lazy load, optimize queries, bundle size
- Security pass: validation, auth checks, env
- Bug fixing and edge cases
- Cross-browser and responsive testing

---

## Activities

- [ ] Finish remaining features from backlog
- [ ] Add loading spinners/skeletons; error messages and retry
- [ ] Empty states and onboarding hints
- [ ] a11y: labels, focus order, contrast
- [ ] Performance: React.memo/lazy where needed; API pagination or caching
- [ ] Security: re-check validation, auth on all protected routes, no secrets in client
- [ ] Test edge cases: empty input, long text, network failure
- [ ] Test on Chrome, Safari, mobile viewport

---

## Focus

- **UX:** user always knows state (loading/success/error); clear CTAs
- **Edge cases:** null/undefined; empty list; 404; duplicate submit
- **Quality:** no known critical bugs; main flows work on target devices
