# Week 20 — Sorting, Searching & Problem-Solving Patterns

**Theme:** Algorithms & Data Structures  
**Suggested time:** 12–16 hours total

## Learning goals

- Sorting: bubble, insertion, selection; merge sort, quicksort
- Binary search (array and applied)
- Two-pointer technique
- Sliding window pattern
- Dynamic programming intro (1–2 classic problems)
- Recognizing problem patterns

## Practice

- [ ] Implement: bubble, insertion, merge sort, quicksort; know time/space
- [ ] Binary search (iterative and recursive)
- [ ] Two-pointer: pair with sum, remove duplicates, valid palindrome
- [ ] Sliding window: max subarray of size k, longest substring with k distinct
- [ ] DP: Fibonacci, climb stairs, or 1–2 from LeetCode DP Easy

---

## What to focus on

- **Sorting:** merge and quicksort O(n log n); when stable sort matters
- **Binary search:** sorted array; also “binary search on answer” for optimization problems
- **Patterns:** many problems reuse two-pointer or sliding window; name them when you see them
- **DP:** state, recurrence, base case; start with 1D problems
