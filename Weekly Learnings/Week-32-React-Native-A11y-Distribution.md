## Practice

- [ ] Add accessibilityLabel and accessibilityHint to key interactive elements
- [ ] Test with VoiceOver (iOS) or TalkBack (Android)
- [ ] Check contrast and minimum touch target size (44pt)
- [ ] EAS Build: create build for iOS and/or Android; install on device
- [ ] Optional: submit to TestFlight or Google Play internal track

---

## Project 7: Convert Web App to Mobile

Take your full-stack (or frontend) project and:

- [ ] Rebuild main UI in React Native
- [ ] Mobile navigation (Stack + Tabs)
- [ ] Add 1–2 native features (camera, push, or location)
- [ ] Optional: offline-first, biometric auth
- [ ] Accessibility: labels, roles, contrast
- [ ] Build for iOS and Android (EAS or local)

---

## What to focus on

- **a11y:** every interactive element has a label; order makes sense for screen reader
- **Build:** EAS simplifies signing and builds; good for portfolio
- **Stores:** guidelines (Apple, Google); privacy policy; screenshots and description
- **Testing:** real devices; different screen sizes and OS versions

---

## Weekly time split (12–16 hrs)

| Activity | Hours |
|----------|--------|
| Accessibility audit + fix | 3–4 |
| EAS Build + device test | 3–4 |
| Project 7: mobile version of web app | 5–8 |
