# Week 4 — JavaScript Basics

**Theme:** JavaScript Fundamentals  
**Suggested time:** 12–16 hours total

---

## Learning goals

- Core syntax: variables, types, operators
- Conditionals and loops
- Functions (declarations, expressions, arrow)
- Arrays and array methods (map, filter, reduce)
- Objects and `this` basics
- Scope and closures intro

## Practice (code in console or small scripts)

- [ ] Variables: `let`, `const`, `var` — when to use which
- [ ] Conditionals and loops
- [ ] Functions: declaration, expression, arrow; parameters and return
- [ ] Arrays: create, access, iterate; `map`, `filter`, `reduce`
- [ ] Objects: properties, methods, shorthand; `this` in simple cases

---

## What to focus on

- **Scope:** block vs function; difference between `let`/`const` and `var`
- **Array methods:** what `map`/`filter`/`reduce` return; chaining
- **Template literals:** `` `Hello ${name}` `` and string methods
- **Closures:** function “remembering” variables from outer scope (intro)
