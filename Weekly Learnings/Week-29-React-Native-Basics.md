# Week 29 — React Native Basics

**Theme:** Mobile Development (React Native)  
**Suggested time:** 12–16 hours total

---

## Learning goals

- React Native vs React (web): no DOM, native components
- Expo: setup and run on device/simulator
- Core components: View, Text, Image, ScrollView, FlatList
- StyleSheet and Flexbox (same as web with minor differences)
- TouchableOpacity, Pressable
- Mobile layout patterns and performance awareness

## Study resources

| Resource | Link | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|
| React Native | [Getting Started](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) | Official |
| Expo | [Tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/) | Recommended path |
| freeCodeCamp | [React Native Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obH0Po_RdWk) | 6 hr |

## Practice

- [ ] Create Expo app (npx create-expo-app); run on simulator/device
- [ ] Build a few screens: layout with View, Text, Image; StyleSheet
- [ ] ScrollView and FlatList (list of items)
- [ ] Buttons: TouchableOpacity and Pressable; feedback and accessibility
- [ ] Compare one layout with your React web app (Flexbox similarities)

---

## What to focus on

- **No div/span:** use View, Text; no HTML elements
- **Styling:** StyleSheet.create; flexbox; no CSS files (or use NativeWind later)
- **Lists:** FlatList for long lists (virtualized); ScrollView for short content
- **Expo vs RN CLI:** Expo easier to start; RN CLI for more native control

## Weekly time split (12–16 hrs)

| Activity | Hours |
|----------|--------|
| Expo setup + React Native docs | 3–4 |
| Components and layout practice | 4–5 |
| Small app (e.g. list + detail screen) | 4–7 |

## Checklist

- [ ] Expo app running on device or simulator
- [ ] Comfortable with View, Text, StyleSheet, FlatList
- [ ] Ready for Navigation (Week 30)
