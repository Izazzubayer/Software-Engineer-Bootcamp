## Learning goals

- JSX syntax and expressions
- Functional components and composition
- Props and prop drilling (and when to avoid it)
- useState and useEffect
- Conditional rendering and lists (with keys)
- Virtual DOM concept (high level)

## Practice

- [ ] Create components: presentational (props only) and stateful (useState)
- [ ] Lists: map over array, key prop, no index as key when list changes
- [ ] useEffect: fetch on mount, cleanup (return function) for subscription or timer
- [ ] Conditional rendering: &&, ternary, early return
- [ ] Small app: e.g. todo list or counter with multiple components

---

## What to focus on

- **Components:** small, reusable; composition over big components
- **Props vs state:** props from parent; state internal; unidirectional data flow
- **useEffect:** dependency array; when it runs; cleanup to avoid leaks
- **Keys:** stable, unique; help React reconcile list items

## Weekly time split (12–16 hrs)

| Activity | Hours |
|----------|--------|
| React docs + tutorial | 4–5 |
| Components, state, effects practice | 4–5 |

## Checklist

- [ ] Built a small app with multiple components and state
- [ ] Used useEffect for data fetch and cleanup
- [ ] Understand props vs state and keys
- [ ] Ready for Advanced Hooks (Week 23)
