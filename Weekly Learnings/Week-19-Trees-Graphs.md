# Week 19 — Trees & Graphs

**Theme:** Algorithms & Data Structures  
**Suggested time:** 12–16 hours total

---

## Learning goals

- Binary trees: traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order)
- Binary search tree (BST): insert, search, delete
- Tree balancing (concept; AVL/Red-Black later)
- Graphs: adjacency list vs matrix
- BFS and DFS on graphs
- Dijkstra’s algorithm (shortest path) — basics

## Practice

- [ ] Implement BST: insert, find, (optional) delete
- [ ] Tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order) — recursive and iterative
- [ ] Graph as adjacency list; BFS and DFS
- [ ] LeetCode: tree and graph Easy/Medium (e.g. max depth, level order, number of islands)

---

## What to focus on

- **Recursion:** tree problems often recursive (solve for left/right, combine)
- **BST:** left < root < right; use for ordered data and O(log n) search when balanced
- **BFS:** queue; shortest path in unweighted; level-order
- **DFS:** stack or recursion; cycle detection, topological sort
