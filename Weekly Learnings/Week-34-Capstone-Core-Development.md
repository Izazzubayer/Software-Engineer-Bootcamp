# Week 34 — Capstone: Core Development

**Theme:** Capstone Project  
**Suggested time:** 12–16 hours total

---

## Learning goals

- Set up frontend and backend per architecture
- Implement authentication (register, login, protected routes)
- Build core features from user stories
- Database integration and API endpoints
- Basic UI for main flows
- Tests for critical paths
- Clean git workflow (feature branches, meaningful commits)

---

## Activities

- [ ] Init frontend (Vite/React) and backend (Node/Express); connect to DB
- [ ] Auth: register, login, JWT (or session); protected API and frontend routes
- [ ] Implement 2–3 core user stories (e.g. create resource, list, view, edit)
- [ ] API: CRUD endpoints; validation; error handling
- [ ] UI: main pages and navigation; forms for create/edit
- [ ] Write tests: auth flow, one core API route, one critical frontend flow
- [ ] Commit often; use feature branches; open PRs for review (or self-review)

---

## Focus

- **Code quality:** consistent style (Prettier/ESLint); meaningful names; small functions
- **Git:** branch per feature; commit messages like “feat: add task create API”
- **Docs:** comment non-obvious logic; update README with setup steps
- **Errors:** handle and return clear messages; log on server

## Weekly time split (12–16 hrs)

| Activity | Hours |
|----------|--------|
| Setup + auth | 4–5 |
| Core features (backend + frontend) | 6–8 |
| Tests + git + docs | 2–3 |

---

## Checklist

- [ ] App runs locally; auth works end-to-end
- [ ] At least 2–3 core features implemented and tested
- [ ] Ready for polish and advanced features (Week 35)
