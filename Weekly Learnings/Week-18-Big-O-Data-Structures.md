# Week 18 — Big O & Basic Data Structures

**Theme:** Algorithms & Data Structures  
**Suggested time:** 12–16 hours total

---

## Learning goals

- Big O: time and space complexity (O(1), O(n), O(n²), O(log n))
- Arrays and array manipulation
- Linked lists (singly, doubly)
- Stacks and queues
- Hash tables/maps
- When to use each structure

## Study resources

| Resource | Link | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|
| freeCodeCamp | [Data Structures Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSGKlAvoiM) | Video |
| Coursera | [Algorithms Part 1 - Princeton](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) | Audit free |
| VisuAlgo | [Visualizing Data Structures](https://visualgo.net/en) | Visual |
| freeCodeCamp | [Big O Notation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo4vesaut8g) | Big O |

**Practice:** LeetCode (Easy), HackerRank, CodeWars

---

## Practice (coding)

- [ ] Implement a stack (array or linked list)
- [ ] Implement a queue
- [ ] Implement a simple hash table (or use Map; understand collision handling)
- [ ] LeetCode/HackerRank: 2–3 Easy array/string/hash problems per day

---

## What to focus on

- **Big O:** worst case; drop constants and lower terms; compare algorithms by growth
- **Arrays:** O(1) access by index; O(n) insert/delete in middle
- **Linked list:** O(1) insert/delete at head; no random access
- **Hash table:** O(1) average lookup/insert/delete; use for fast lookups and counting

## Weekly time split (12–16 hrs)

| Activity | Hours |
|----------|--------|
| Big O + data structure videos | 4–5 |
| Implement stack, queue, hash table | 3–4 |
| LeetCode Easy (array, hash, string) | 4–7 |

---

## Checklist

- [ ] Can explain Big O for a simple loop and nested loop
- [ ] Implemented at least 2 structures from scratch
- [ ] Solved 5+ Easy problems on LeetCode
- [ ] Ready for Trees & Graphs (Week 19)
